# Sleeping-Dogs-Textures-Noesis-Plugin
Noesis plugin for viewing Sleeping Dogs texture files stored in .perm.bin and .temp.bin containers

- Place the python file inside plugins/python in your Noesis directory.

- Rename ".perm.bin" to ".sd" and ".temp.bin" to ".sd2" so Noesis doesn't confuse them with Models files
